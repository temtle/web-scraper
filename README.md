# web-scraper
Relatively simple web scraper I made using python, the elements to be parsed and selected need to be adjusted per website but all in all it's functional!

It searches by listing url and goes through the pages, scraping every item inside each page, and recursively calling the function to check the next page

Make sure to adjust the elements as stated, and also the url of the listing at the site you want to search down at the very bottom at line 87

Also, make sure to remove the comments I put around the pagination section at line 75
